        <p>'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,' added the Gryphon; and then they
            both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to
            the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:
            'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it—'

            to beach this boat on yonder island, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightning strike me!'A
            pretty scholar,' laughed the Lakeman. 'Adios, Senor!' and leaping into the sea, he swam back to his
            comrades.</p>
